MneeMart Demo Content
========================

Thank you for testing MneeMart - the Pay-to-Decrypt Web3 Marketplace!

This file demonstrates how encrypted content works:
1. The seller uploads a file which gets encrypted using Lit Protocol
2. The encrypted file is stored on IPFS
3. Only users who purchase the product can decrypt and download

Key Features:
- MNEE Stablecoin payments on Ethereum
- Lit Protocol for access control
- IPFS for decentralized storage
- No central database required
